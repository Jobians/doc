![Introducing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jobians/doc/main/blog/img/img1.png)

We are very happy to introduce [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) to help you manage one or many open source websites.

We created [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) for the following reasons:

1. To put the focus on writing good documentation instead of worrying about the infrastructure of a website.
1. To provide features that many of our open source websites need like blog support, search and versioning.
1. To make it easy to push updates, new features, and bug fixes to everyone all at once.
1. And, finally, to provide a consistent look and feel across all of our open source projects.

Docusaurus is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details. At its core, all a user has to provide are documentation files written in markdown, customization of a provided home page written in React, and a few configuration modifications. Docusaurus handles the rest by providing default styles, site formatting, and simple document navigation. Getting started is easy, as users can [install](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html) it using `npm` or `yarn` via a simple initialization script that [creates a working example website out of the box](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/site-preparation.html).
